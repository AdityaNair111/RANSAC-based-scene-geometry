# Camera Calibration and Fundamental Matrix Estimation with RANSAC

# Setup
- Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda). It doesn't matter whether you use 2.7 or 3.6 because the project will create its own environment anyways.
- Create a conda environment using the given file by modifying the following command based on your OS (`linux`, `mac`, or `win`): `conda env create -f environment_<OS>.yml`
- This should create an environment named `ransac`. Activate it using the following Windows command: `activate ransac` or the following MacOS / Linux command: `source activate ransac`.
- Run the notebook using: `jupyter notebook ./code/proj3.ipynb`
